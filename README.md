Online Geometry Viewer is an online web application, where users can upload, view
and share 3D CAD models. They can also host these models online, can like (love)
or comment on them. In a nutshell it can be looked at as a social blogging 
platform for 3D models. 

## Contribution Guidelines
TL;DR
We love contributions, if you want to contribute make sure you are on development branch to see the latest code. To prevent any duplicate work, please communicate if you are working on something. 

The best (but not the only) way to contribute is
* Check if the issue you are trying to solve is already reported. (search the issue tracker)
* If it is already created, comment with your willingness to work on it.
* If it is not created, please create a new one. In any case try to inform about what you are working on.
* Make sure you are on latest code (`development` branch)
* Make sure when you make a Pull request, it is to the development branch.
* [optional] Assign a reviewer from one of the contributors, specially if you are new and have been talking to existing contributors.
* Never merge your own pull requests.
* Always check the "files changed" tab for any surprises. 
* Be polite and nice.
